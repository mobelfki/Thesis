	abstract = {The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is the central   scintillator-steel sampling hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS   experiment at the LHC . Jointly with other calorimeters it is   designed for energy reconstruction of hadrons, jets, tau-particles   and missing transverse energy. The scintillation light produced in   the scintillator tiles is transmitted by wavelength shifting fibers   to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The analog signals from the PMTs   are amplified, shaped and digitized by sampling the signal every   25 ns. The TileCal frontend electronics reads out the signals   produced by about 10000 channels measuring energies ranging from   ∼30 MeV to ∼2 TeV . Each stage of the signal production   from scintillation light to the signal reconstruction is monitored   and calibrated.  The performance of the calorimeter has been   established with cosmic ray muons and the large sample of the   proton-proton collisions. The response of high momentum isolated   muons is used to study the energy response at the electromagnetic   scale, isolated hadrons are used as a probe of the hadronic response   and its modelling by the Monte Carlo simulations. The calorimeter   time resolution is studied with multijet events.  Results on the   calorimeter operation and performance are presented, including the   calibration, stability, absolute energy scale, uniformity and time   resolution. These results show that the TileCal performance is   within the design requirements and has given essential contribution   to reconstructed objects and physics results.}

abstract = "Recently iterative procedures have been proposed for track and vertex fitting in counter experiments. We show that the proper theoretical framework for these procedures is the theory of linear filtering, in particular the Kalman filter. Using results from filtering theory we confirm and extend the previous results. We also discuss the detection of outliers and of secondary vertices."

	abstract = {While many high energy experiments use track fitting software that is based solely on the Kalman Filter technique, the ATLAS offline reconstruction also has several global track fitters available. One of these is the GlobalChi2Fitter, which is based on the scattering angle formulation of the track fit. One of the advantages of this method over the Kalman fit is that it can provide the scattering angles and related quantities (e.g. the residual derivatives) to the alignment algorithms. The algorithm has been implemented in the new common tracking framework in ATLAS, the philosophy of which is to improve the modularity and flexibility of the tracking software. This flexibility has proven crucial for the understanding of the data from the testbeam and cosmic runs. An overview of recent results will be presented, in particular the results from the combined tracking with the inner detector and the muon spectrometer using the cosmics data.}

abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of the Hough transform, HT, in image processing and computer vision. It has long been recognized as a technique of almost unique promise for shape and motion analysis in images containing noisy, missing, and extraneous data but its adoption has been slow due to its computational and storage complexity and the lack of a detailed understanding of its properties. However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area.}
