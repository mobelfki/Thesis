\textbf{To Be Added}
%I would like to thank all the people I have had the chance to meet and work with during the past years. \\
%The first person I would like to thank is my supervisor, Stephane Jezequel, for having given me the opportunity to do my thesis at LAPP as well as my master project and his availability to answer my "stupid" questions and correcting my mistakes. I would like also to thank him for his effort and time correcting my French and English documents. \\

%Further, I would like to thank the "rapporteurs", Maarten Boonekamp and Roberto Salerno, as well as the other members of my jury, Lucia Di Ciaccio, Arnoud Duperrin, Elisabeth Petit and Lydia Roos for having accepted to be part of my jury. \\

%A special thanks goes to Nicolas Berger and Francesco Constanza, without them this thesis would probably not be what it is. Thanks for all the discussions about physics, machine learning and analysis. These discussions were interesting and very helpful. I learned a lot from you. \\

%I would like to thank the di-Higgs  and in particular the \HHyybb team for the collaboration, teamwork and for the feedback during many meetings. \\

%Without forgetting the EGamma and the photon ID teams. Thank you very much for your time and help. \\

%I would like to thank all members from the ATLAS group at LAPP for the amazing working atmosphere. I would line to thank also PhD students and postdocs for the nice lunch, coffee breaks and games. \\
%A special thanks goes here to Luca Franco with whom I was sharing the office I would like to thank you for your help, time and discussion even those that goes beyond physics. Thanks for all the fun we had in the office or around the lake in Annecy
