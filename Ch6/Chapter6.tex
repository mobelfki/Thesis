\chapter{Prospects of Higgs pair production at Run-3 and HL-LHC}
\label{HL-LHC}

With the full Run-2 data, the 95\% CL interval for \kl modifier is -1.5 $\leq$ \kl $\leq$ 6.7 using the \HHyybb decay channel. At the end of Run-3, the expected integrated luminosity is around 300 \ifb, while for HL-LHC the integrated luminosity can achieve 3000 \ifb at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV ( 2 and 20 times the Run-2 respectively). The Higgs pair production search will benefit from the luminosity increase and can achieve a precision of 50\% on \kl at 68\% CL. Prospects for the measurement of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling at Run-3 and HL-LHC will be presented in this chapter.
